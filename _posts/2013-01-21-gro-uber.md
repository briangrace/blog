================

I rep a Grouper t-shirt every, single day. (Fortunately, I have a few).

There are two reasons why I do this:

I don't have to think about what to wear.
Free advertising.
The first reason I stole from Steve Jobs. His iconic outfit is often misunderstood. He wore that famous black mock turtleneck, Levi’s, and New Balances not to make a fashion statement, but almost for the complete opposite reason: so he didn’t have to think about what to wear. Apple is a tremendously focused company and it stemmed from a leader who tuned out all distractions, even ones as trivial as getting dressed.

The second reason was inspired by Larry and Sergey. An early [Google](http://google.com) investor told me that they wore their Google t-shirts every day in the early years. "Free advertising," they explained.

Startups are hard. Every little bit helps.
