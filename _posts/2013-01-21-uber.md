Today we're extremely excited to announce a partnership with one of _our_ favorite apps: Uber, which let's you order an on-demand ride from your phone.

Grouper aims to create an experience that's so easy it almost feels magical. We tell you where to go and who to meet so you don't have to stress about the details. Now you don't have to worry about how to get there.
