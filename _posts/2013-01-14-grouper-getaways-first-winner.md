Today we're psyched to announce the first-ever winners of our [Grouper Getaways]("https://www.joingrouper.com/getaways") contest. The [rules]("https://www.joingrouper.com/getaways") were simple: go on a Grouper, take an epic [groupergram]("https://www.joingrouper.com/groupergrams") and share it on [Facebook]("http://facebook.com/joingrouper"). Then let the best group win.

Our winners, John and Tracy's crews, who met at Faux Pas Bistro in LA, are going to Vegas! We'll be [picking another winner]("https://www.joingrouper.com/getaways") in just 2 weeks... so get on it!
