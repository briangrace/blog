Today we're extremely excited to announce a partnership with one of _our_ favorite apps: Uber, which let's you order an on-demand ride from your phone.

Grouper aims to create an experience that's so easy it almost feels magical. We tell you where to go and who to meet so you don't have to stress about the details.

Uber is a smartphone app that connects you with friendly, reliable black car service anywhere at any time. With Uber, you just enter your pickup location, hop in the luxury vehicle that arrives at your doorstep, and get out at your destination. You don't even need to take out your wallet.
 
To celebrate this booming partnership, we want to send you on an **UberGrouper**. *We’ll hook you up with VIP matching, two rounds of drinks at one of the hottest spots in your city, and round-trip Uber rides to and from your Grouper. All for the low, low price of free!* Entering to win this exclusive package is easy – become a member of Grouper and tweet “#UberGrouper” between Monday, January 21st and Friday, January 25th for a chance to win.
