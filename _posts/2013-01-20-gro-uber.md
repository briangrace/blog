Angelina has Brad, Ben has Jerry, and now Grouper has its own partner in crime: Uber! That’s right, Grouper is teaming up with one of the most popular ride-requesting services around to bring you the ultimate Grouper experience, the… wait for it… UberGrouper!  
 
(For those of you new to the on-demand ride world,) Uber is a smartphone application that connects users with friendly, reliable black car service anywhere at any time. With Uber, you just enter your pickup location, hop in the luxury vehicle that arrives at your doorstep, and get out at your destination [all transactions occur through the app]. 
 
To celebrate this booming partnership, we want to send you on an UberGrouper. We’ll hook you up with VIP matching, two rounds of drinks at one of the hottest spots in your city, and round-trip Uber rides to and from your Grouper. All for the low, low price of free! Entering to win this exclusive package is easy – become a member of Grouper and tweet “#UberGrouper” between Monday, January 21st and Friday, January 25th for a chance to win.
