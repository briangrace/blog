I rep a Grouper t-shirt every, single day. (Fortunately, I have a few).

There are two reasons why I do this:

I don't have to think about what to wear.
Free advertising.
The first reason I stole from Steve Jobs. His iconic outfit is often misunderstood. He wore that famous black mock turtleneck, Levi’s, and New Balances not to make a fashion statement, but almost for the complete opposite reason: so he didn’t have to think about what to wear. Apple is a tremendously focused company and it stemmed from a leader who tuned out all distractions, even ones as trivial as getting dressed.

The second reason was inspired by Larry and Sergey. An early Google investor told me that they wore their Google t-shirts every day in the early years. "Free advertising," they explained.

Startups are hard. Every little bit helps.
