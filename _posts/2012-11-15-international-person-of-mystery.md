Grouper is looking to hire an [International Man of Mystery](https://www.joingrouper.com/mystery). 

This person needs to be fluent in 3 languages, to know the best bars in 5 countries, and to be relentlessly resourceful. Not to mention they must be a university graduate, a Mac user at home, extremely social, highly interesting, and a natural-born leader--with leadership experience, as well. 

Some nice-to-have skills would be: the aim to hit a bullseye from 100 yards with a 7mm Walther PPK, the taste to distinguish the subtle differences between Dom Perignon 1952 and 1954 vintages, trained in martial arts, the ability to drive stick (with no hands), and the distinction of having never, ever lost a card game.

We are looking to [fill the position immediately](https://www.joingrouper.com/mystery), so please [read more about the position](https://www.joingrouper.com/mystery), [apply for it](https://www.joingrouper.com/jobs), or [forward along](https://www.joingrouper.com/mystery) to a friend who you think fits the description.
